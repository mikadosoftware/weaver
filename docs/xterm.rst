==============
Terminal setup
==============

I am aiming to build a Unicode aware development enviroment that suits my now tired old eyes.
For now I am aiming just for inconsolata on xterms

.. include:: ../fabmodules/fab_terminal_setup.py
    :start-line: 10
    :end-line: 20
    :code:	       


So this is a useful technique for referencing code actually in my project
without the autodocs approach.  Just note the relative import from the `docs/` dir.
